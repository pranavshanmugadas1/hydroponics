        <h1 id="head-1">Hydroponics</h1>
        <p>Hydroponics is the best upcoming field of farming. It has yielded great success which no one has
            capitalized on with automation. Yet. This is what we intend to do with our hydroponics robot.
            Our robot uses several tools such as IOT (Internet Of Things) and ML (Machine Learning) to provide individual care
            to crops so that you can yield the perfect harvest. Similar to our traditional farming robot, we intend to
            use swarm robotics to systematically cultivate plants and other crops to perfection. We can achieve this
            by using a combination of machine vision to detect the overall health of the plants and provide the
            necessary nourishments such as our concoction of citric and carbonic acids for obtaining the optimum pH
            level required for the crops. Also, our Potassium Nitrate solution enriches the plant with proteins as
            Potassium Nitrate is the most efficient source of potassium.</p>

        <h1 id="head-2">Why Choose Us?</h1>
        <p>So, why choose us when there are plenty of other farming tools you could use?<br>Through
            a rigorous amount of research, we found that if our product becomes a full-fledged instrument, it can offer a 40%
            decrease in maintainance and labour costs, while also offering a 21% increase in plant
            growth as it gives individual attention to each plant.</p>

        <h1 id="head-3">About Us</h1>
        <p>This project was made under the supervision of Aditya Rajkumar and Aarya Sivakumar of class 9B, CAIE.
            This website was made by Pranav Shanmugadas. Other major contributers of this project are 
            Abhimanyu Agarwal (who gave us meaningful support) and Parthiv Shanmugadas , who made the trifold.</p>

        <h1 id="head-4">Honorable Mentions</h1>
        <p>Jothendra. The most epic person in the history of epicness. He greatly helped us by providing emotional
            support and inspiration to be like him someday, although he is too epic for us and we will never attain
            such a state of epicness. <br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
